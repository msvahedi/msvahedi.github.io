title: Bing, Create!
---

I've recently found a useful and entertaining AI named Bing and in this post what I'm going to share is my 1st attempts of creating some pictures with it.

**DESCRIPTION:** I wanted "a computer engineer student" with her headphones on ,coding and sitting on a cozy cafe's coach with a coffee in her hand (though last part didn't work!)

**DESCRIPTION:** This time I mentioned "a black hair girl" to make it the way I imagined and also made her ALONE to make the picture feel sad, but didn't work like I expected...

**DESCRIPTION:** In the end, I added the "sad atmosphere" to see if AI can simulate feelings or not! Also thought a rainy evening would be nice in the background... and TADA!!!
